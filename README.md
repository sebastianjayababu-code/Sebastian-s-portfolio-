Data Labeling Job Simulation 
Completed a job simulation where I worked as a Data Labeling Analyst for a hypothetical AI company, reviewing real customer support messages
Practiced classifying messages for Intent, Sentiment, and PII (personally identifiable information) using a consistent labeling schema
Evaluated tricky or ambiguous edge cases, and wrote short rationales justifying final label decisions
Reviewed labeling work done by others, identified inconsistencies, and suggested one improvement to the team’s labeling guidelines
Strengthened my ability to apply clear definitions, follow ethical privacy practices, and maintain consistency across data
Gained hands-on experience in human-AI collaboration, foundational to roles in AI ops, trust & safety, and machine learning support
